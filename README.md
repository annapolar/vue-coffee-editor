# Vue Coffee Editor

A personal Vue.js practice side project that I use v-model to do the two-way data binding and apply it to control the graph and more interesting interaction. The demo is an app concept. In this app, the user can make a cup of coffee with their mobile app. What's fun? It allows the user to choose the coffee type and cup size, besides, the user can also adjust the ratio of the ingredients.
